--------------------------------
Evaluate the CV against the job posting with the mindset of a critical friend who tells the uncomfortable truth because it matters. No softening. No polite cushioning. Get straight to the point and call out every weakness that reduces credibility.

## 1. Strip the role down to essentials  
Identify the fundamental skills and responsibilities the new hire must handle. Focus only on what is required for day one productivity and fast growth.

## 2. Check for real evidence, not claims  
For each essential requirement, classify the CV as:  
- Solid evidence  
- Thin evidence  
- No evidence  

Flag any vague language, padded experience, buzzword dumping, or empty statements.

## 3. Risk factors that would burn a team  
### List issues that commonly derail junior hires.
Examples:
-No real proof they can build anything usable
- Overreliance on tutorials instead of self directed work
- No debugging or problem solving examples
- Unclear communication
- Weak portfolio depth
- Projects that look copy pasted or templated
Be blunt.

## 4. Strengths that actually matter  
- Highlight strengths with real value for a role.
- Ignore things like random online certificates, irrelevant achievements, vague “leadership roles”, or inflated coursework.

## 5. Coachability check  
Judge whether the candidate seems coachable:  
- Likely coachable  
- Unclear  
- Unlikely coachable  

Justify with specific signals in the CV.

## 6. Grammar, clarity, and professionalism check  
Call out issues such as:  
- Grammar mistakes  
- Misspellings  
- Awkward phrasing  
- Inconsistent tense  
- Weak or generic language  

State clearly if the writing quality suggests carelessness or weak communication skills.

## 7. Visual clutter and layout check  
Evaluate how readable and professional the CV is. Call out:  
- Walls of text  
- Poor hierarchy
- Overuse of colors
- Star ratings of skills without proof that no one cares about  
- Random bolding  
- Multiple font styles  
- Inconsistent spacing  
- Overly cramped layout
- Layouts that look like Canva templates gone wrong  

Explain how visual clutter reduces credibility.

## 8. Formatting and font expectations  
State whether the document follows proper professional formatting.

**Preferred structure:** Oxford CV format  
**Best performing tech CV layout principles:**
- Single column, clean, left aligned  
- Logical section order: contact, summary, skills, education, experience, projects, links  
- Bullet points instead of paragraphs  
- Action plus impact format for each bullet  
- Clean spacing and consistent margins  
- No icons, no colors, no timeline graphics  
- One page for junior candidates  
- Skim friendly structure  

**Acceptable fonts:**  
- Helvetica  
- Arial  
- Calibri  
- Inter  
- Times New Roman  

### Call out any deviations that reduce clarity or professionalism.
### Flag any font choices that look unprofessional, outdated, or inconsistent.

## 9. Technical depth reality check
Assess whether the candidate shows real understanding:
- Explains what they built  
- Highlights problems solved  
- Uses correct technical terminology  
- Shows reasoning, not just tool usage  

If the CV is shallow or surface level, say it directly.

## 10. Portfolio or GitHub credibility
Check whether linked work shows real capability:
- Real projects vs empty repos  
- Commit history quality  
- Clear README files  
- Dead links  
- Tutorial clones  

Explain how each signal affects credibility.

## 11. Cultural fit check
Evaluate alignment with fundamental workplace values:
- Ownership  
- Humility  
- Willingness to learn  
- Accountability  
- Collaboration  

Call out red flags like overconfidence without evidence, entitlement, or poor teamwork signals.

## 12. Motivation honesty check
Evaluate whether the candidate’s stated motivation sounds:
- Genuine  
- Shallow  
- Confused  
- Fabricated  

Call out generic statements, flattery, or evidence they don’t understand the job.

## 13. Immediate dealbreakers
List reasons the candidate should be rejected instantly:
- Zero proof of core skills  
- Major grammar issues  
- Chaotic layout  
- Fake or exaggerated projects  
- No signal of problem solving  
- No curiosity or initiative  

## 14. Final verdict
Give:
- A score from 0 to 10  
- 2-3 blunt sentences summarizing the candidate  

Examples: not hireable, borderline, salvageable with heavy guidance, workable junior, decent junior, strong early potential, good potential for mid level candidate.
