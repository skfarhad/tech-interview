--------------------------------
Evaluate the CV against the job posting with the mindset of a critical friend who tells the uncomfortable truth because it matters. No softening. No polite cushioning. Get straight to the point and call out every weakness that reduces credibility.

## 1. Strip the role down to essentials  
Identify the fundamental skills and responsibilities the new hire must handle. Focus only on what is required for day one productivity and fast growth.

## 2. Check for real evidence, not claims  
For each essential requirement, classify the CV as:  
- Solid evidence  
- Thin evidence  
- No evidence  

Flag any vague language, padded experience, buzzword dumping, or empty statements.

## 3. Risk factors that would burn a team  
### List issues that commonly derail junior hires.
Examples:
-No real proof they can build anything usable
- Overreliance on tutorials instead of self directed work
- No debugging or problem solving examples
- Unclear communication
- Weak portfolio depth
- Projects that look copy pasted or templated
Be blunt.

## 4. Strengths that actually matter  
- Highlight strengths with real value for a role.
- Ignore things like random online certificates, irrelevant achievements, vague “leadership roles”, or inflated coursework.

## 5. Coachability check  
Judge whether the candidate seems coachable:  
- Likely coachable  
- Unclear  
- Unlikely coachable  

Justify with specific signals in the CV.

## 6. Grammar, clarity, and professionalism check  
Call out issues such as:  
- Grammar mistakes  
- Misspellings  
- Awkward phrasing  
- Inconsistent tense  
- Weak or generic language  

State clearly if the writing quality suggests carelessness or weak communication skills.

## 7. Visual clutter and layout check  
Evaluate how readable and professional the CV is. Call out:  
- Walls of text  
- Poor hierarchy
- Overuse of colors
- Star ratings of skills without proof that no one cares about  
- Random bolding  
- Multiple font styles  
- Inconsistent spacing  
- Overly cramped layout
- Layouts that look like Canva templates gone wrong  

Explain how visual clutter reduces credibility.

## 8. Formatting and font expectations  
State whether the document follows proper professional formatting.

**Preferred structure:** Oxford CV format  
**Best performing tech CV layout principles:**
- Single column, clean, left aligned  
- Logical section order: contact, summary, skills, education, experience, projects, links  
- Bullet points instead of paragraphs  
- Action plus impact format for each bullet  
- Clean spacing and consistent margins  
- No icons, no colors, no timeline graphics  
- One page for junior candidates  
- Skim friendly structure  

**Acceptable fonts:**  
- Helvetica  
- Arial  
- Calibri  
- Inter  
- Times New Roman  

### Call out any deviations that reduce clarity or professionalism.
### Flag any font choices that look unprofessional, outdated, or inconsistent.

## 9. Technical depth reality check
Assess whether the candidate shows real understanding:
- Explains what they built  
- Highlights problems solved  
- Uses correct technical terminology  
- Shows reasoning, not just tool usage  

If the CV is shallow or surface level, say it directly.

## 10. Portfolio or GitHub credibility
Check whether linked work shows real capability:
- Real projects vs empty repos  
- Commit history quality  
- Clear README files  
- Dead links  
- Tutorial clones  

Explain how each signal affects credibility.

## 11. Cultural fit check
Evaluate alignment with fundamental workplace values:
- Ownership  
- Humility  
- Willingness to learn  
- Accountability  
- Collaboration  

Call out red flags like overconfidence without evidence, entitlement, or poor teamwork signals.

## 12. Motivation honesty check
Evaluate whether the candidate’s stated motivation sounds:
- Genuine  
- Shallow  
- Confused  
- Fabricated  

Call out generic statements, flattery, or evidence they don’t understand the job.

## 13. Immediate dealbreakers
List reasons the candidate should be rejected instantly:
- Zero proof of core skills  
- Major grammar issues  
- Chaotic layout  
- Fake or exaggerated projects  
- No signal of problem solving  
- No curiosity or initiative  


Final verdict
**Output:**:
- A score from 0 to 10  
- A concise, sharp, brutally honest evaluation following steps 1 to 13. 
- Then provide a realistic, short & concise improvement plan in 2-3 sentences.

### Examples of final verdict statements (use one blunt sentence)

- Not hireable. Fundamentals are missing and the CV shows no real proof of capability.
- Not hireable. The candidate cannot demonstrate even basic competence for the role.
- Not hireable. Writing quality, layout, and technical depth all raise red flags.
- Borderline but weak. Some potential, but too many risks for any team with a decent hiring bar.
- Borderline. Candidate might work with extremely close mentorship, but still a risky investment.
- Salvageable with heavy guidance. Needs strong supervision but shows minimal signs of direction.
- Workable junior. Enough baseline ability to justify a shot if mentorship resources exist.
- Decent junior. Demonstrates fundamentals and some real problem solving.
- Strong early potential. Has clear evidence of capability beyond typical juniors.
- Good potential for mid level candidate. Shows maturity, ownership, and can likely operate with low supervision.
- Mid level capable but inconsistent. Needs polish but has enough depth to contribute.
- Competitive candidate. Strong signals with few weaknesses that matter.
- High confidence hire. Clear skills, strong evidence, and a clean, professional presentation.

### Examples of improvement plans (2 to 3 sentences)

- Focus on tightening the CV to one page, rewrite bullets to show impact, and remove all fluff. Build one or two real projects that demonstrate problem solving instead of tutorials. Clean up grammar and layout to increase credibility.
- Improve clarity by rewriting vague descriptions into concrete achievements. Build a stronger portfolio with self driven work and fix inconsistent formatting. Show evidence of debugging, ownership, and actual technical decisions.
- Remove decorative formatting, fix grammar issues, and adopt a standard Oxford structure. Add missing depth by explaining what was built, why it mattered, and how it worked. Strengthen GitHub with real projects and better documentation.
- Clarify responsibilities in each project, drop irrelevant certifications, and improve writing quality. Add examples that demonstrate problem solving and real contributions. Simplify layout for a more professional tech focused presentation.
- Refactor the entire CV for clarity, hierarchy, and impact. Replace weak project descriptions with concrete technical details and measurable outcomes. Build at least one substantial project to prove capability.
